    <p>We are applied probabilists with interests in the modeling and analysis of stochastic systems, theoretical statistics, stochastic optimization and control. Current research interests include: 1. Applied Probability & Queueing Theory

- Developed models for **non-stationary and transitory queues**, including diffusion approximations in oscillatory regimes.
- Published work on **calibration of non-stationary queueing networks** and queue inference from indirect observations.

### 2. Stochastic Control & Reinforcement Learning

- Developed foundations for **reinforcement learning in continuous-time systems**, including:
  - Impulse/discontinuous control
  - Optimal exploration policies
- Gave invited talks (e.g., *Towards a Theory of Exploration in Continuous-Time RL*).

### 3. Controlled Markov Chain Estimation

- Designed **adaptive, nonparametric minimax-optimal estimators** for transition densities in controlled Markov chains.
- Derived **sample complexity bounds** and considered mixing properties and policy structures.

### 4. Optimization under Uncertainty & Bayesian Methods

- Contributions to:
  - **Sample-average approximation** in stochastic optimization over function spaces
  - **Bayesian joint chance-constrained optimization**
  - **Distributed high-dimensional regression** </p>
